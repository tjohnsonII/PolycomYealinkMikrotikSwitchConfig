Inbound Routes
What Are Inbound Routes?
Inbound Routes control how FreePBX handles incoming calls from external sources — usually via SIP trunks. These routes match on one or more conditions (like the dialed number or caller ID), and then send the call to a destination like:

An extension
A ring group
An IVR
A queue
A time condition
Voicemail
A custom destination
Match Criteria

DID Number
The DID is the phone number dialed by the outside caller.
When a call hits your trunk, FreePBX looks at this field to determine the route.
You can:
Leave it blank to match all DIDs
Enter a full 10- or 11-digit number (e.g., 2485551234)
Use partial matches or wildcards (like _248555XXXX)
Caller ID Number
Matches based on the incoming caller's number.
Used for special cases like VIP routing or blocking known spam callers.
Can be exact match or patterns (e.g., 248555% for area code filtering)
Key Configuration Options

Description: Internal label (e.g., Main Line, Sales DID, After Hours Route)
Set Destination: Choose where to send the call: Extension, ring group, IVR, announcement, etc.
Alert Info: Sends custom alert to phones (e.g., different ring tone). Yealink/Polycom can use this for distinctive ring tones.
CID Lookup Source: Automatically performs a reverse lookup (e.g., caller name) from a CNAM provider
Recording Options: Record the call from this point forward. Override global settings.
Privacy Manager: Forces anonymous callers to enter their number. Useful for blocking spam or anonymous calls.
Time-Based Routing (Using Time Conditions)
Inbound Routes can pass calls to Time Conditions, allowing you to:

Route differently during business hours vs. after hours
Set holiday-specific routes
Combine with Call Flow Control for manual overrides
Example:
Inbound Route (DID: 2485551234) → Time Condition → If open → IVR, If closed → Voicemail

Real-World Examples

Standard Routing: DID 2485551234 → Rings extension 1001
IVR Menu: DID 2485552000 → Goes to main IVR menu for call routing
After-Hours Message: All calls → Play announcement: "Our office is currently closed"
Dispatch Failover: Known caller ID 5865551100 → Ring mobile backup number via Misc Destination
VIP Routing: Caller ID 2485555555 → Direct to management's ring group
Advanced Use Cases

Combine multiple inbound routes with overlapping DIDs for layered routing logic.
Set specific Caller ID entries for numbers that bypass menus and go directly to agents.
Create "Catch-All" route with blank DID/CID to handle unrecognized calls as a fallback.
Use Inbound Routes → Time Condition → Call Flow Control for dynamic routing via BLF.
Tips for Managing Inbound Routes

Tip	Description
Use descriptive names	e.g., Main Line - Day, Main Line - After Hours
Keep DID formatting consistent	Match what's sent by your SIP provider (10 vs. 11 digits)
Route to Time Conditions	Gives you flexible control and easy overrides
Don’t forget the fallback	A "catch-all" route prevents dropped calls if no DID match occurs
Document routing logic	Especially useful if using IVRs, queues, or layered flows
Firewall
Overview: What Does the FreePBX Firewall Do?
The FreePBX Firewall:
Filters traffic by source IP address and port
Organizes access via zones (internal, external, trusted, etc.)
Automatically blocks threats and scanning attempts (via Fail2Ban)
Allows or denies access to services like:
Web GUI (HTTP/HTTPS)
SSH
SIP/PJSIP
UCP, Zulu, REST API, etc.
It works hand-in-hand with iptables (on Linux) and can be customized to protect a local system, cloud PBX, or hybrid deployment.

Firewall Zones (Core Concept)

Zone	Description	Use Case
Trusted	Full access, no restrictions	LAN, VPN peers, known public IPs
Local	Only for services running on the system (loopback)	127.0.0.1
Internal	Allows PBX services (phones, UCP, etc.)	Office subnets
External	Blocked by default, can whitelist services	Internet, unknown IPs
Other	Catch-all zone for unclassified traffic	Used for alerts/monitoring
Blacklist	Permanently banned IPs	Malicious traffic, SIP scanners
Services Controlled by Firewall

Service	Description
Web Interface (Admin, UCP)	HTTP/HTTPS access to FreePBX GUI
SIP/PJSIP	Call signaling ports (usually UDP 5060, 5160)
RTP Media	Voice traffic (UDP ports 10000–20000 by default)
SSH	Secure shell for remote access
REST API / AMI	Used by advanced applications or external integrations
Responsive Firewall	Dynamically adjusts rules based on traffic
Responsive Firewall
This feature allows remote phones or clients to connect dynamically:
Accepts new connections temporarily
Uses SIP registration attempts to whitelist the IP
If registration is successful, the IP is added to the Internal zone for a limited time
Supports PJSIP, IAX, and SIP transport
Use Case: Remote Yealink or Bria softphone connects from home IP, gets added automatically.

Intrusion Detection (Fail2Ban)
Monitors logs for brute-force attempts (SIP, SSH, web logins)
Automatically bans IPs after too many failed attempts
Ban time and retry limits are configurable
Logs can be viewed in /var/log/fail2ban.log

Configuration Tabs

Status
Current firewall mode: Enabled/Disabled/Testing
Summary of running services and zones
Interfaces
Classify each network interface (e.g., eth0) as:
Trusted / Internal / External
Typically: WAN = External, LAN = Internal
Networks
Whitelist or blacklist specific IPs or ranges
Add remote offices, admin IPs, or mobile networks here
Services
Toggle allowed services (per zone)
Select which zones can access SIP, HTTP, SSH, etc.
Advanced
Adjust default ports
Modify fail2ban ban times
Manage logs and performance settings
Best Practices

✅ Whitelist your management IPs (under "Networks")
✅ Set your LAN interfaces to Trusted or Internal
✅ Disable unnecessary services (e.g., Web UI over WAN)
✅ Use Responsive Firewall for remote phones
✅ Monitor intrusion logs and adjust thresholds as needed
✅ Use secure SIP passwords and avoid predictable extensions
Common Troubleshooting Tips

Symptom	Possible Cause	Fix
Remote phones can't register	IP not whitelisted or responsive firewall not working	Use Responsive mode or manually allow IP
GUI unreachable from remote	Web access not allowed for External zone	Temporarily move IP to Trusted zone
Calls fail or drop	RTP ports not allowed through firewall/NAT	Allow UDP 10000–20000 and ensure correct NAT setup
Fail2Ban too aggressive	False positives from SIP scanners	Adjust ban time or retry limit in Advanced settings
Extensions
What is an Extension?
An extension in FreePBX represents a user endpoint on the phone system — usually a physical phone, a softphone, or a device that registers via SIP or PJSIP.
You assign a unique number (like 101, 202, etc.) to each extension. That number becomes the internal "phone number" for that device or user.

Protocol Types (PJSIP)
When creating an extension, you choose a technology driver:
PJSIP (recommended for new deployments):
Modern protocol stack
Supports multiple registrations (e.g., multiple devices per user)

Common Extension Settings

User Extension: The internal number (e.g., 1001). Unique across the system.
Display Name: Human-friendly label (e.g., John Smith). Appears on devices and in FreePBX GUI.
Secret / Password: SIP/PJSIP registration password. Should be long and secure (randomized).
Voicemail Settings: Enable/disable, email delivery (with or without attachment), greeting preferences, VMX Locater (press-to-redirect options while caller is in voicemail).
CID Options: Outbound CID controls what caller ID is presented when this extension calls out. Can override trunk-level CID with format: “John Smith” <2485551234>.
Device Options: NAT (enable for devices behind NAT/firewalls), DTMF Mode (typically RFC2833 or Auto), Transport (UDP / TCP / TLS for SIP signaling).
Advanced Settings: Call recording (always, never, on-demand), language code (for system prompts), codec preferences (e.g., G722, ulaw, alaw, G729), Qualify/Keepalive (ensures phone is reachable).
Features Tied to Extensions

Find Me/Follow Me: Enable follow-me behavior for calls to this extension. Ring internal and external numbers sequentially or simultaneously.
Call Recording: On-demand or always-record per extension. Saved in /var/spool/asterisk/monitor.
Call Forwarding: Forward all/busy/unavailable to another extension, external number, or voicemail.
Call Waiting / Call Screening / Call Announce: Fine-grained controls over how additional calls are handled. Can require caller to say their name before connecting.
Voicemail to Email: Email notifications of new voicemails. Attachments and delete-after-send options.
User Control Panel (UCP): If enabled, users can:
Listen to voicemail
Review call history
Manage recordings
Adjust Find Me/Follow Me
Send/receive faxes (if enabled)
Chat (with commercial modules)
Users log into UCP via the FreePBX web interface using their extension number and user password.
Registration: How Phones Connect
A phone or softphone must be configured with:
Username: The extension number (e.g., 1001)
Password: The SIP/PJSIP secret
Server: IP or FQDN of the FreePBX system
Port: Typically 5060 (UDP for SIP, or 5061 for TLS/PJSIP)
Once registered, the device can:
Receive calls directly
Make internal and outbound calls
Use BLFs and other features

Extension States
Extensions can be in different states:
Idle: Available for calls
In Use: On a call
Ringing: Incoming call
Unavailable: Unregistered or not reachable
These states are used by BLF lights and call center logic

Use Cases
Personal devices (e.g., desk phones)
Softphones (e.g., Zoiper, Bria, Linphone)
Remote users (via VPN or NAT-aware SIP)
Call groups (used with ring groups/queues)

Ring Groups
📁 What Is a Ring Group?
A Ring Group is a way to ring multiple extensions simultaneously or in sequence when a call is received. It’s typically used to reach a department, team, or group of phones (e.g., Sales, Support, Reception).
Think of it as a mini broadcast system for inbound or internal calls.

🛠️ Common Use Cases

Ring all front desk phones at once
Call a group of remote support reps in order
Overflow logic: ring extension 100 for 10 seconds, then ring 101 and 102
Combine with Inbound Routes, IVRs, or Queues
🔧 Core Configuration Options

Ring-Group Number
The internal number to dial this group (e.g., 600).
Can also be a destination for Inbound Routes or IVRs.
Group Description
Label to identify purpose (e.g., Sales Team, Tech Support)
Extension List
Add one or more extensions or external numbers (e.g., 100, 101, 2485551234#).
Use # at the end of external numbers.
100 101 102 2485557890#
Ring Strategy
Controls how the phones ring:
ringall: Ring all at once
hunt: Ring one at a time in order
memoryhunt: Ring one, then add the next, etc.
firstavailable: Rings the first free extension
random: Randomized order
Ring Time

🔔 Additional Features

CID Name Prefix
Adds a prefix to the caller ID on phones in the group.
Example: Sales: makes incoming CID show as Sales:2485551212
Ignore CF Settings
Ignore individual extensions' call forwarding (recommended for group integrity)
Disable Call Forwarding
Prevent users from forwarding group calls to external destinations
Enable Call Confirmation
Required when calling external numbers (e.g., cell phones).
Prompts remote user to "Press 1 to accept the call"
Remote Announce / Too-Late Announce
Audio prompts played to external users when they answer

🧼 Best Practices

Tip	Why
Use CID Prefixes	Helps staff know what type of call it is
Use Call Confirm on external numbers	Prevents calls from hitting personal voicemail
Limit Ring Time	Avoids long ringing and faster failover
Document each group’s role	Keeps your call flow organized
Avoid loops	Don’t send a failed call back into the same group
🔗 Ring Groups vs. Queues

Feature	Ring Group	Queue
Call distribution	Simultaneous/sequential	Rules-based (round robin, etc.)
Music on hold	No	Yes
Caller position	No	Yes
Agent login/logout	No	Yes
Ideal for	Small teams, simple routing	Call centers, advanced control
Queues
🎯 What is a Queue?
A Queue is a structured call-holding system in FreePBX. When callers enter a queue:
They wait on hold until an available agent can answer.
Calls are distributed based on defined strategies (e.g., round robin, least recent).
Agents can log in/out of queues manually or dynamically.
You can provide music on hold, caller position, and estimated wait time.

🛠️ Where to Configure Queues

Admin GUI: Applications → Queues
🧩 Core Queue Settings

Queue Number
Internal extension number for the queue (e.g., 600)
Queue Name
Label that appears in reports and agent displays (e.g., Support Line, Billing Queue)
🧑‍💼 Agent Configuration

Static Agents
Predefined list of extensions (always part of the queue):
100 101 102
Dynamic Agents
Agents log in/out with feature codes (e.g., *45).
Good for hot-desking or rotating teams.
Can also use hotdesk provisioning or Sangoma Phones' presence states.
🎛️ Key Call Handling Options

Time Conditions
⏰ What is a Time Condition?
A Time Condition is a logic object that checks the current time against a defined schedule (called a Time Group), and routes the call accordingly.
It functions like an IF/ELSE statement:
IF current time matches time group → send call to Destination A ELSE → send call to Destination B

🧩 Key Components

Time Group
A reusable schedule definition that includes:
Days of the week
Time ranges (e.g., 9:00 AM–5:00 PM)
Specific dates or months (e.g., holidays)
Combinations of the above
You can create multiple time groups in:
Admin → Time Groups
Time Condition
A logic block that uses a Time Group to make routing decisions.
Configure in: Admin → Time Conditions
Main Fields:
Field	Description
Time Condition Name	Label (e.g., "Open Hours Routing")
Time Group	The schedule to evaluate (e.g., “Office Hours”)
Destination if time matches	Where the call goes during matching hours
Destination if time does not match	Where the call goes outside of those hours
Optional Call Flow Toggle Feature Code	Lets you override the logic manually
📞 Common Use Case Examples

🏢 Business Hours Routing
Time Group: “Business Hours”
Mon–Fri | 9:00 AM – 5:00 PM
Time Condition: “Main Line Logic”
If in business hours → go to IVR
If outside hours → go to after-hours voicemail or announcement
🎄 Holiday Routing
Create a “Holiday Dates” time group:
Add dates: Dec 25, Jan 1, etc.
Time Condition: "Holiday Check"
If date matches → route to "We're closed" announcement
Else → go to normal hours logic
Inbound Route → Time Condition (Holiday Check) → If YES → Holiday Announcement → If NO → Time Condition (Office Hours) → If YES → Ring Group → If NO → After Hours Voicemail
⌨️ Manual Override
Time Conditions optionally support a feature code (like *271):
Allows users to toggle the logic manually (e.g., early closure)
Can be tied to a BLF button on phones (shows red/green status)
🔁 Real-World Examples

Example 1: Office Line with Voicemail Failover
Time Group: Mon–Fri, 9–5
Time Condition:
Match: Ring Group 600 No Match: Voicemail 600
Example 2: Lunch Break Routing
Time Group: Mon–Fri, 12:00–1:00 PM
Time Condition:
Match: Play "We’re at lunch" announcement No Match: Normal IVR
✅ Best Practices

Tip	Why
Name time groups descriptively	Easier to manage multiple schedules
Use layered logic	Stack holiday, open/close, and lunch conditions
Use override feature codes	Staff can toggle logic without admin access
Use separate conditions for holidays	Avoids disrupting normal hours logic
Add BLF buttons for toggles	Visually monitor and control routing state
🛠 Time Condition vs. Time Group (Quick Summary)

Feature	Time Group	Time Condition
Stores schedule data	✅	❌
Makes routing decisions	❌	✅
Can be reused across multiple flows	✅	❌
Uses IF/ELSE logic	❌	✅
Announcements
📣 What is an Announcement?
An Announcement is a module in FreePBX that:
Plays a pre-recorded message (audio file)
Then routes the call to another destination
There’s no user interaction during the announcement — it’s just informational playback before the call proceeds.

🧩 Where to Configure

FreePBX GUI: Applications → Announcements
🔧 Key Settings

Field	Description
Announcement Name	Internal label (e.g., “Office Closed Notice”)
Recording	The audio file to play (choose from system recordings or upload)
Allow Skip	If enabled, the caller can press # to skip the message
Repeat Message	Replays the message before moving on
Return to IVR	If the call came from an IVR, you can return the caller back to it
Destination after Playback	Where to send the call next (e.g., extension, IVR, voicemail)
🎙 Recording the Audio

Upload .wav or .mp3 files in Admin → System Recordings
Record from an extension using *77
Use Text-to-Speech (via third-party services) to generate audio
📞 Common Use Cases

🕗 After-Hours Message
“Thank you for calling. Our office is currently closed. Please leave a message after the tone.”
Destination: Voicemail
📦 Shipping or Info Update
“Due to inclement weather, shipping may be delayed.”
Destination: Ring Group or Queue
🚫 Call Blocking / Spam Handling
“This number does not accept unsolicited calls.” → hang up
Destination: Terminate Call → Hang Up
🔁 Loop Back to IVR
“Please listen carefully to our new menu options.”
Destination: Return to IVR
🔁 Integrated Call Flows

Inbound Route (DID: 2485551234) ↓ Time Condition (if outside business hours) ↓ Announcement: “We are closed.” ↓ Voicemail box
🛠 Tips for Using Announcements

Tip	Why
Keep messages short	Avoid frustrating callers
Enable skip (#) for long messages	Allows faster navigation
Use professional recordings	Enhances credibility
Test playback volume	Avoid distortion or silence
Use announcements before IVRs	Sets context for menu options
✅ Best Practices

Use consistent naming: Name your recordings and announcements clearly (e.g., after_hours_greeting.wav, HolidayNotice2025)
Segment announcements: Break long messages into reusable pieces (e.g., generic closure message + department-specific routing)
Use return to IVR carefully: Prevent loops by confirming the call originated from an IVR
🧠 Related Modules

System Recordings: Where audio files are created or uploaded
IVRs: Announcements are often used before or inside menus
Time Conditions: Direct callers to announcements based on time or date
IVR (Interactive Voice Response)
🎛️ What is an IVR?
An IVR (Interactive Voice Response) is an automated phone menu that allows callers to press keys (DTMF) to navigate to different departments, people, or services.
It's commonly known as a "press 1 for Sales, press 2 for Support" system.

🧭 What IVRs Do in FreePBX

Play an audio message (e.g., "Welcome to XYZ Company…")
Let the caller press digits (0–9, *, #) to trigger actions
Route the call to:
Extensions
Queues
Ring groups
Announcements
Voicemail
Other IVRs (nested menus)
🛠 Where to Configure
FreePBX GUI: Applications → IVR

🧩 Core IVR Configuration

Setting	Description
IVR Name	Internal name (e.g., "Main Menu")
Announcement	The greeting audio (recorded file or uploaded)
Enable Direct Dial	Allows callers to dial extensions at any time
Timeout	How long to wait for input (in seconds)
Invalid Retries	How many times to let the caller retry after a wrong input
Invalid Retry Recording	What to play if they press an invalid option
Timeout Destination	Where to send the call if the caller does nothing
Return to IVR	After an invalid or timeout destination, return to this IVR
Allow Key Press Events Early	Accepts input even while audio is playing
🔢 IVR Entries (Options)
Each menu option is a digit (0–9, *, #) that maps to a destination.

Key Press	Destination
1	Sales Queue (600)
2	Support Queue (601)
3	Billing Ring Group (603)
0	Operator Extension (100)
*	Voicemail Box
You can also use:

i → Invalid input destination
t → Timeout destination
🎧 IVR Audio (Announcement)
You must upload or record an audio file that tells the caller what to do.
E.g.: "Thank you for calling. For Sales, press 1. For Support, press 2. To dial an extension, press 0 now."
Create recordings in Admin → System Recordings.

🔁 Nested IVRs (Multi-Level Menus)
You can create submenus by pointing an IVR option to another IVR.
Example:

Main Menu (press 2 → Support Menu)
Support Menu (press 1 → Tech Support Queue, 2 → Customer Portal FAQ announcement)
This keeps menus short and easy to follow.

🧠 Real-World Example
Inbound Route → Time Condition → IVR

Inbound DID: 248-555-1000 ↓ Time Condition: - Open → Main IVR - Closed → Announcement: "We're closed" ↓ Voicemail Main IVR: - 1 → Sales Queue - 2 → Support Queue - 0 → Operator - No input → Timeout → Voicemail
🔒 Security & Best Practices

Practice	Why
Disable direct dial unless needed	Prevents callers from guessing extension numbers
Set invalid/timeouts	Prevents infinite loops or dead ends
Use BLF overrides	Let staff control menu behavior manually (e.g., *289)
Keep audio concise	Avoid long menus; aim for <30 seconds
Log changes	Document IVR name, options, recordings, and routes
💡 Tips for Design

Limit to 3–5 options per IVR
Make sure prompts clearly match the options
Reuse audio recordings when possible (e.g., "Our office hours are...")
Use CID name prefixing when routing calls through IVR to help agents identify menu origin
✅ Related Modules

System Recordings: Where you upload or record the audio files
Time Conditions: Send calls to different IVRs based on time of day

    Miscellaneous Destinations: Allows routing to external numbers or special dial strings (e.g., analog door phones).

🌐 Trunks

Trunks connect your PBX to the outside world.

    SIP/IAX2/PRI

    Outbound and Inbound calls flow through trunks

    Must be configured with your provider’s details

🧭 Dial Plans & Outbound Routes

    Dial Plan: Rules that match user dialed numbers (e.g., 9|1NXXNXXXXXX to strip 9 and dial 11-digit US).

    Outbound Routes: Routes based on dialed pattern → send to correct trunk.

    Can apply caller ID masking, failover trunks, and PIN codes.
