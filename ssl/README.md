# SSL Certificates Directory

This directory contains SSL certificates and private keys for HTTPS support.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

**IMPORTANT**: Private keys and certificates are **NEVER** committed to version control for security reasons.

## Required Files for HTTPS

### Self-Signed Certificates (Generated by setup-ssl.sh):
- `certificate.pem` - Self-signed certificate
- `private-key.pem` - Self-signed private key

### No-IP Certificates (User-provided):
- `timsablab_ddns_net.crt` - No-IP certificate
- `PrivateKey.key` - No-IP private key (matches certificate)
- `DigiCertCA.crt` - Intermediate CA certificate
- `TrustedRoot.crt` - Root CA certificate

## Setup Instructions

### For Self-Signed Certificates:
```bash
./setup-ssl.sh
```

### For No-IP Certificates:
1. Obtain certificates from No-IP
2. Copy certificate files to this directory
3. Ensure private key is named `PrivateKey.key`
4. Run: `./setup-https-certs.sh` to verify setup

## Files in .gitignore

All certificate and key files are excluded from version control:
- `ssl/` directory is fully excluded
- `*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.crt` files are excluded globally
- Only this README.md file is tracked

## Usage

### Test Certificate Setup:
```bash
./setup-https-certs.sh
```

### Start HTTPS:
```bash
./switch-https.sh https
```

### Start HTTPS on Port 443:
```bash
sudo ./start-https-443.sh
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit private keys** to version control
2. **Set restrictive permissions** on private keys (600 or 700)
3. **Use trusted certificates** for production (like No-IP)
4. **Regularly rotate certificates** before expiration
5. **Monitor certificate expiry** dates

## Certificate Validation

The setup scripts automatically verify that certificates and private keys match to prevent SSL errors.
